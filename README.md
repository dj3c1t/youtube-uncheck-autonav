# youtube-uncheck-autonav
A basic Chrome extension that unchecks the autonav toggle on Youtube.

The autonav toggle, on Youtube, is the one you have to unckeck if you don't want a new video to be automatically loaded after the current one ends.

This is a stubborn, basic plugin. On Youtube pages, every 5 seconds, if what seems to be an enabled autonav toggle is found, the plugin triggers a click on it.
