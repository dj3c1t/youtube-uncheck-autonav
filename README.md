# youtube-uncheck-autonav
A chrome extension that unchecks the autonav toggle on Youtube.

This a simple script that checks every 5 seconds for the autonav toggle on Youtube (the one you have to unckeck if you don't want Youtube to automatically load a new video after the current one ends).

On Youtube pages, every 5 seconds, if what seems to be an enabled autonav toggle is found, the plugin triggers a click on it.
